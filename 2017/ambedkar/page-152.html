On my tablet, <span class="_ _1"></span>I had a few </div><div class="t m0 x4 h8 y1bd ff5 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls7 ws0">writings of Dr Ambedkar. While surfing through the<span class="_ _1"></span>m I opened ‘Castes </div><div class="t m0 x4 h8 y1be ff5 fs4 fc0 sc0 lsa ws0">in India: Their Mechanism,<span class="_ _1"></span> Genesis and Development,’ the rese<span class="_ _1"></span>arch </div><div class="t m0 x4 h8 y1bf ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls5 ws0">paper Ambedkar had prese<span class="_ _1"></span>nted in the Anthropology <span class="_ _1"></span>Conference of </div><div class="t m0 x4 h8 y1c0 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls5 ws0">Columbia University in 191<span class="_ _1"></span>6.

Within two hours, </div><div class="t m0 x4 h8 y289 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls8 ws0">almost in one breath, I fini<span class="_ _1"></span>shed reading that short but<span class="_ _1"></span> enlightening text. </div><div class="t m0 x4 h8 y28a ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls2 ws0">Anthropology has always been a<span class="ls0"> <span class="ls4">subject of my fa<span class="_ _1"></span>scination.

But most </div><div class="t m0 x4 h8 y298 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls5 ws0">of those thinkers were Eur<span class="_ _1"></span>opeans.
