At that time, he did not ask me any<span class="_ _1"></span>thing, but as we </span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 ybe ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls12 ws0">reached home he asked wh<span class="_ _1"></span>at happened to me and if t<span class="_ _1"></span>here was </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 ybf ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls4 ws0">something to be unhappy about. I refused to tell him a<span class="_ _1"></span>nything and told </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc0 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls5 ws0">him it was nothing... I kept <span class="_ _1"></span>thinking whether I s<span class="_ _1"></span>hould spend the money<span class="ls0"> </span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc1 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls5 ws0">buying a new sweater, and <span class="_ _1"></span>was unable to sleep t<span class="_ _1"></span>hat night. Should I tell </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc2 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls6 ws0">my parents and see if they have something to sa<span class="_ _1"></span>y? Should I not buy a </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc3 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls4 ws0">sweater, and save the money instead? But how was I to<span class="_ _1"></span> face the teacher </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 y1d5 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls5 ws0">next day without a new sw<span class="_ _1"></span>eater?<span class="ls0"> </span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc5 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 lsa ws0">I kept that<span class="ls0"> <span class="ls5">prize money nea<span class="_ _1"></span>r the television. <span class="ls0"> Even after<span class="_ _1"></span> three or four </span></span></span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc6 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 lsf ws0">days, no one asked me why<span class="_ _1"></span> the money was still there. I used to get very </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc7 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 lsf ws0">disturbed whenever I saw t<span class="_ _1"></span>hat. Finally, one day, my father said jokingly, </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc8 ff5 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls9 ws0">“It is fine if you do not want this money.

I </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yca ff5 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls5 ws0">need it.” He then asked wh<span class="_ _1"></span>y it remained near the<span class="_ _1"></span> television, unused. I </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 y1db ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls12 ws0">replied that I had not yet d<span class="_ _1"></span>ecided what to do with the <span class="_ _1"></span>money, and until </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 y1dc ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 lsa ws0">I decided on something,<span class="ls0"> to <span class="_ _1"></span>please let it be there. After that there was no </span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 y1dd ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls6 ws0">mention of this money.

She came out and started shouting at <span class="_ _1"></span>me, saying that </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 y183 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls7 ws0">the whole class was unhygienic because of me, and th<span class="_ _1"></span>at I should </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 y1e3 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 lsa ws0">immediately go home, chan<span class="_ _1"></span>ge my sweater and come ba<span class="_ _1"></span>ck to school! She </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 y1e4 ff5 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls8 ws0">also said things like “Does <span class="_ _1"></span>your mother <span class="ls5">not care about<span class="_ _1"></span> you?” and “You </span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 y1e5 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls5 ws0">people are so dirty!
