However,<span class="_ _1"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yf0 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls7 ws0">through different opport<span class="ls0">unities in his life, he achieved <span class="_ _1"></span>a status which no </span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc4 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 lsa ws0">Indian could have achieved<span class="_ _1"></span> in that situation. He studie<span class="_ _1"></span>d Indian society </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc5 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls7 ws0">thoroughly and diagnosed the problem that is Brahma<span class="_ _1"></span>nism. Therefore, </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc6 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls5 ws0">he appealed for annihilatio<span class="_ _1"></span>n of caste.

So, throughout his life he tried to <span class="_ _1"></span>find various ways </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yc9 ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls7 ws0">to annihilate the caste system in India. For example, e<span class="_ _1"></span>mbracing </div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 yca ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls4 ws0">Buddhism and leaving Hinduism, making a democrati<span class="_ _1"></span>c<span class="ls0"> <span class="ls7">constitution </span></span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 y1db ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls7 ws0">where untouchability was declared illegal, burning of<span class="ls0"> <span class="ff3 ls9">Manusmriti</span> <span class="ls8">and so </span></span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 y1dc ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 ls5 ws0">on.<span class="ls0"> </span></div><div class="t m0 x1 h8 y3c ff2 fs4 fc0 sc0 lsa ws0">India is a country where m<span class="_ _1"></span>ore than six thousand castes exist.
